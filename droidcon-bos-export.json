  "conductCode" : "<p>We want <b>Droidcon Boston</b> to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. To that end, this code of conduct     spells out the behavior we support and don't support at conferences. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and     volunteers at our conference are required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this     code throughout the event.</p>  <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of     gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,     national origin, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We invite you to help us make     <b>Droidcon Boston</b> a place that is welcoming and respectful to all participants. So that everyone can focus on the     conference itself, learning and growing in their own way, and the great networking and community richness that     happens when we get together in person, we will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form—in     person or online.</p>  <p>Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, intimidation, stalking, harassing     photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual     attention. Harassment also includes slights and negative messages, both unintended and intentional, based solely     on appearance (sometimes called micro-aggressions). Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any     conference setting.</p>  <p>We expect all participants to follow the Code of Conduct during the conference. This includes conference-related     social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to     stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of     Conduct may be expelled from the conference without a refund, and/or banned from future <b>Droidcon Boston</b>     events.</p>  <h3>Need Help?</h3>  <p>Reach out to any conference organizer if you have questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct itself or the     behavior of any participants before, during or after the conference. We will treat all violations of the Code of     Conduct seriously. You can also email us at <b>coc@droidcon-boston.com</b>.</p>",

Optimizations sometimes involve trade-offs – optimizing one metric can regress other and in this talk I will go over some performance trade-offs we faced at Instagram. I will also describe our modularization and lazy loading effort where we compile some features to separate dex files and load them on demand, whenever needed to further speed up cold start. At Instagram we aim to write modularized code with features being encapsulated and decoupled. This gives us better control over when a feature is first invoked and its code loaded into memory. We try to make sure that only core features are loaded in memory during cold start. To further speed up cold start time and overall runtime we put features into separate dex files and load them lazily whenever needed. This also applies for native libraries. And this can actually bring a benefit to disk footprint if some features remain unused.</p>",

As users can access those apps from a variety of devices without the need to stop what they're doing to check a screen, the use of conversational apps is expected to grow dramatically.

In this talk, we'll review the new set of APIs that Android Things bring to developers, what supports, how to start and how to approach the platform as hobbyist, without necessary having an electronics background and how to build some Android powered robots.</p>",

Every time you update a version of a dependency, do you have to change several different files? Did you change all the 'compile's to 'api's and called it a day? As your project keeps growing, as more and more modules are added, does your build time seem to increase exponentially? You've seen some of the gradle files in sample projects, marveled at their pristine, geometric beauty, and muttered, \"Maybe someday, on a greenfield far, far away...\" The gap between that ideal and reality seems far, far apart.</p>\n<p>Now open your eyes.&nbsp;There is a more pragmatic approach to cleaning your gradle files. They don't have to be perfect, and the cleaning process can be iterative. In this talk, Clive will go over some of the practical steps you can take to organize your gradle files, bit by bit.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover dependency versioning, sharing configurations across multiple modules, product flavors, variant filters, project properties, source sets, version codes, custom gradle tasks, and more!</p>",

We’ll start with the basics, assuming no prior knowledge and move slowly into more advanced topics, such as 2-way binding, binding adapters and converters. &nbsp;This is a hands-on workshop with instructor led coding, so please bring your laptops with the latest version of Android Studio installed! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

We’ll examine the APIs available in each of the options to see what is and isn’t possible.
