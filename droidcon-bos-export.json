We recognize that an utterly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù environment is not achievable for all possible attendees, but we commit to fostering an event that is safer, to the best of our ability. To that end, this Code of Conduct spells out behavioral expectations for all attendees (including staff, speakers, and sponsors) at the conference. Droidcon Boston Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p> <p>We hope to provide a great conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technological choices or experience. We invite you to help us make Droidcon Boston 2019 a place that is welcoming and respectful to all participants. We will not tolerate harassment of conference participants‚Äîin person or online.</p> <p>Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Unacceptable behavior also includes slights and negative messages, both unintended and intentional, based on appearance (sometimes called microaggressions). Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference setting and are not welcome at Droidcon Boston 2019.</p> <p>All attendees, speakers, staff, and sponsors of Droidcon Boston 2019 must wear their badges during the event, with name unobscured. Anyone whose badge is not easily visible risks being asked to leave the event.<p> <p>We expect all participants at Droidcon Boston 2019 to adhere to the Code of Conduct in all areas of the conference. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, in related online communities, and on social media. People asked to stop a behavior are expected to comply immediately. Behavior that violates this Code of Conduct will be promptly addressed and may result in a conversation about expected changes in behavior, expulsion from the conference without a refund, and/or banning from future Droidcon Boston events.</p> <h3>Need Help?</h3> <p>If you have questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct itself, or the behavior of any participants before, during or after the conference, reach out to any person on our safety team. You can identify safety team members by their <strong>green Droidcon Boston T-shirts</strong>.

Among these tools is the&nbsp;reactive programming paradigm. While many have heard of reactive&nbsp;programming, far less have a solid understanding of what it is, how to&nbsp;achieve it, and what benefits it may provide. The Android communities&nbsp;use of RxJava as a replacement for the AsyncTask class has lead to&nbsp;widespread adoption of reactive technologies without a corresponding&nbsp;embracing of reactive programming.<br>\n</p>\n<p>In this talk, we‚Äôll review&nbsp;what reactive programming is and what its history is. We‚Äôll then address&nbsp;the ways in which the Android community has been using reactive&nbsp;technologies and how it could take the next step in adopting these&nbsp;technologies towards creating end to end reactive apps. We‚Äôll take a&nbsp;deep dive into how RxJava integrates with the Android LiveData classes&nbsp;and when to use which. We‚Äôll work through a small but meaningful&nbsp;application to demonstrate reactive programming concepts in the Android&nbsp;world. We‚Äôll end the example by looking at how the code can be (easily)&nbsp;tested and some of the benefits we‚Äôve received from utilizing a reactive approach.<br>\n</p>\n<p>- Introduction to reactive programming and its benefits for UI development<br>\n- Overview of LiveData and how it relates to reactive programming<br>\n- Similar overview for RxJava<br>\n- How the Android community is currently using RxJava and the deficiencies in how many view the library<br>\n- Simple example of a reactive app<br>\n- Building up to a more complex example of an end to end reactive app using both LiveData and RxJava<br>\n- Using JUnit tests in a reactive context<br>\n- Recapping the benefits of the reactive development with the now finished example app<br>\n- Conclusion</p>",

There are a few choices to accomplish this, such as using plain Threads, AsyncTasks, or the popular Rx Java framework if you dread to manage threads in your own code (who doesn't).</p>\n<p>In this talk, we'll narrow down the choices to two candidates. The first one is the popular Rx Java framework and the second one is the newly minted Coroutines feature in Kotlin.

Since you're a teacher, you should care about being a <em>good</em> teacher. Good teaching empowers those around you and nurtures healthy technical communities. Also, teaching doesn't need to be entirely altruistic - often the best way to truly learn something is to teach it.</p>\n<p>My education career started over a decade ago. It has included teaching at an all girl's STEM school in Rwanda and for the last five years as an online instructor for Google's Android courses. The Google courses are by far the biggest \"classroom\" I've been a part of, with a diverse and driven pool of students. Android has also had seismic changes over the past few years. These facts combined make Android a subject where teachers need to continually adapt, iterate and hone their skills.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll share what it's like behind the scenes: scripting, filming and producing Android classes for hundreds of thousands of students, including what we got right, and what took a few tries. From this, I'll cover reflections and practical takeaways about teaching Android and teaching in general. Because I am a teacher and so are you!<br>\n</p>",

How do these crash reporters do what they do to make our debugging lives easier? Let‚Äôs find out! In this session, you'll learn how to create a crash reporting SDK from scratch using Android's UncaughtExceptionHandler, starting by capturing and sending stack traces to an HTTP endpoint. We'll then progressively add functionality onto our crash reporter until it's turned into a battle-tested SDK that we're confident will save us hours of debugging crashes in production.<br>\n</p>\n<p>As expected diving deeper into the inner workings of our tools, we‚Äôll encounter challenges along the way. We‚Äôll analyze the various scenarios, what they mean for our apps, and how to best go about solving for them given tradeoffs and solutions. Here are some of the challenges we‚Äôll encounter:<br>\n</p>\n<p>For starters, we‚Äôll discuss the design constraints caused by working in a low-memory environment, and how streaming IO and JSON serialization can help us capture OutOfMemoryErrors. We‚Äôll also learn the best practices of caching undelivered reports on disk for future delivery and triggering automatic upload of reports in response to connectivity changes. We‚Äôll consider privacy issues, like how we can collect useful metadata about the device and application at the time of crash while respecting user privacy by filtering sensitive information. To further expand our tool, we‚Äôll capture exceptions caught in a try-catch block and discuss the difficulties with ensuring thread-safety in these situations. Then we‚Äôll move on to the various strategies for testing a crash reporter and walk through the benefits of black-box end-to-end tests.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Another issue to examine is how we can deobfuscate stack traces in apps which use R8‚Äîwe‚Äôll review uploading a mapping file to an HTTP endpoint and read its contents to reveal a readable stack trace. There are even things we can do to highlight the most useful parts of stack traces as well as thinking through grouping related errors together. Then we‚Äôll consider supporting different API levels and how it affects the collection of useful data, and finally, we‚Äôll touch on capturing errors in NDK apps and the potential pitfalls in the Java Native Interface.<br>\n</p>",

Specific recommendations will be offered for making an app feel like it's native to a Chromebook's visual environment. We'll then talk about file management, which works somewhat differently on Chromebooks compared to conventional Android devices. We'll look at how the Chromebook's local file system is shared with the container that manages Android apps, and how to work with Google Drive through the Storage Access Framework API. And finally, we'll explore the Chromebook's USB ports and what they offer for both file transfer and audio output.</p>",

Throughout this talk, you‚Äôll see some animated goodness and you‚Äôll learn some of the fundamentals of how MotionLayout works. You‚Äôll find out what a MotionScene is and how you can use it to separate your states and transitions from your layout, how to use click and swipe handling to trigger transitions, how we can take advantage of KeyAttributes to tweak animations at certain frames, how to use CustomAttributes to animate certain parts of a View and more!</p>\n<p>You will leave this talk armed with the basic knowledge required to start having fun with MotionLayout and creating your own animations and transitions.

Then focusing on the crucial step in a design sprint, we build high fidelity prototypes in rapid succession utilizing the JetPack Android software components (UI, Behavior, Foundation, Architecture) to take full advantage of the Android platform.&nbsp;We do this by leveraging the design features of Android Studio (material components/theme editor, constraint library, motion editor) along with open source/industry resources to build an intuitive and beautiful UI.</p>\n<p>Once the UI framework is done, we write the Kotlin application logic utilizing the Android Architecture Components with data binding connected to Firebase for the synchronized backend. With our application finished we execute our strategy for marketing, distribution, and monetization guided by Data-Driven Ethnography (DDE).&nbsp;At the end of the session, the audience will have a good idea of how in rapid secession all these tools and components come together to produce magic.</p>",

In this talk, we'll review some of the advantages of using Flutter, how to tackle common challenges when adopting it and how can it spark a better collaboration between designers and developers, including roles and responsibilities, a well-defined feedback process and our own experience while building an app. Interested? &nbsp;Let's chat about it over a beverage of your choice.</p>",
