Toothpick is the best of both worlds!  Toothpick is a scope tree based, runtime but reflection free implementation of JSR 330. It is pure Java, with a special focus on Android. Toothpick is fast (even faster than Dagger 2 in some cases!) and is simpler to use, with less boilerplate code. Its syntax is very close to Guice. It supports named dependencies, lazy dependencies, providers, and has built-in support for custom scopes. As compared to Dagger 2, Toothpick provides more powerful testing support, allowing you to leverage DI to mock dependencies using either mockito or easymock. Its explicit scope tree helps developers to build more robust apps. It provides more fine grained control to easily implement complex user flows that span multiple activities or state preservation across configuration changes (e.g. rotations), a common issue when implementing the MVP pattern.  During this talk for experts, we will introduce Toothpick, its main features and how it compares to other DI libs.

Yet, there are 1.3 billion smartphone users living in emerging market countries like India or Indonesia who are limited by the relative high cost of mobile data. 500 MB of data costs a user in India 17 hours of minimum-wage work in India. In the United States, the same amount of data costs only 3.5 hours worth of minimum-wage-work. But, the hunger for Internet access and smartphones is not slowing down. By 2020, emerging markets will have more than 2.5 billion smartphone users and the demand for Internet access will increase by 500%.

Traditionally, this has involved using multiple toolkits and managing the complexity of costs and interactions across them. With Firebase Analytics, the process is unified (single toolkit), cost-effective (unlimited & free) and comprehensive (standard & custom events) — not to mention easy to use.  In this talk, we will take a look at how easy it is to integrate Firebase Analytics and use the resulting insights to not just understand user behaviors, but also to improve user experience and engagement (with data-driven UX decisions) and to better monetize those interactions. The first half of the talk will focus on the Firebase Analytics API (front-end) and its usage (with code) to capture user events and establish relevant contexts. The second half of the talk will focus on the Firebase Analytics Dashboard (back-end) and its usage to filter, track and visualize user behaviors in individual and collective contexts.  Finally, we will explore popular scenarios requiring behavior analytics and walk through how these can be implemented using the APIs and Dashboard provided by Firebase Analytics.
